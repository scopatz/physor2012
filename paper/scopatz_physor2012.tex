\section{INTRODUCTION} 
Creating full-core, homogenized neutron group-to-group scattering cross sections
for nuclear power reactors is traditionally done via Monte Carlo methods (such as
MCNPX \cite{}).  Computing region or sub-region kernels may be performed in much 
the same way.  However, these methods homogenize not only over reactor geometry
but over material composisition as well.  For perturbation-based reactor models 
\cite{}, nuclide specific scattering cross sections are needed.

Perturbation-based reactor models (such as those in Bright \cite{}) use a 
set of precomputed libraries (such as those generated by Char \cite{}).
These libraries are comprised of microscopic neutron cross sections 
or reaction rates for each nuclide for a given reactor state.  For reactor 
specifications that are not one of the precomputed states, two or more libraries
are interpolated at run-time to form a dynamically generated core.  This mechanism
grants large performance gains over transport methods while maintatining 
acceptable core performance fidelity.

For multi-energy group reactor models using the above algorithm, the scattering 
cross section $\sigma_{s,g\to h,i}$ [barns] is needed to be able to perform 
consistent interpolations. (Here, the subscript $s$ denotes the scattering channel, 
the subscripts $g$ \& $h$ index $G$ incident and exiting energies, and the subscript
$i$ indexes $I$ species.)  This parameter is notbaly more important in thermal reactors
than fast cores.  Furthermore, previous single energy group studies \cite{} did 
not require the group-to-group scattering cross section at all because both 
$g$ \& $h$ are intergated over.

While most Monte Carlo neutron transport codes may compute few group cross
sections (\emph{i.e.} $\sigma_{s,g,i}$), most fail to expose the distribution
of neutron exiting energies after a reaction ($\sigma_{s,g\to h,i}$).  Those
codes which do report exiting energies display only the sum over all consitiuent 
materials in the region of interest ($\sigma_{s,g\to h}$).  Thus obtaining 
the parameters for a perturbation-based reactor model is itself a challenge.

In the initial scoping of library generation (Char) two burnup-coupled transport 
codes were considered: MCNPX (v2.6+) and Serpent (v1.7+).  MCNPX confers the 
ability to compute $\sigma_{s,g,i}$.  Serpent by default will calculate 
$\sigma_{s,g\to h}$ and allows the user to compute $\sigma_{s,g,i}$ as well.

Becuase the group-to-group scattering cross section was already natively supported, 
Serpent was ultimately chosen to statisfy the group constant generation needs of
Char.  However, the source code of Serpent needed to be altered to support 
the reporting of $\sigma_{s,g\to h,i}$.  This modified verion is available upon
request from the author\footnote{This is subject to the same license and restrictions
as Serpent itself.}.

The success of the perturbation-based multigroup model itself serves to validate
the modifications made to Serpent.  However, this study presents a sensitivity study 
which focuses on the group-to-gorup scattering cross section as calculated via 
the modified Serpent.  Here the fuel pin radius set to two different values and 
$\sigma_{s,g\to h,i}$ is calculated for all nuclides.  Values for the scattering 
kernel for intermediate fuel radii were then found via interpolation and modified Serpent 
and compared.  Additionally full-core and region group constants were also compared.

In \S \ref{sec:methodology} is an explantion of the modifications made to Serpent 
and the detailing of the sensitivity study performed.  In \S \ref{sec:results} the 
reults of the sensitivity study are presented.  Lastly, \S \ref{sec:conculsions}
discusses concluding remarks and potential future work.
