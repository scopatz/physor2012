\section{INTRODUCTION} 
Creating full-core, homogenized neutron group-to-group scattering cross sections
for nuclear power reactors is traditionally done via Monte Carlo methods (such as
MCNPX \cite{}).  Computing region or sub-region kernels may be performed in much 
the same way.  However, these methods homogenize not only over reactor geometry
but over material composisition as well.  For perturbation-based reactor models 
\cite{}, nuclide specific scattering cross sections are needed.

Perturbation-based reactor models (such as those in Bright \cite{}) use a 
set of precomputed libraries (such as those generated by Char \cite{}).
These libraries are comprised of microscopic neutron cross sections 
or reaction rates for each nuclide for a given reactor state.  For reactor 
specifications that are not one of the precomputed states, two or more libraries
are interpolated at run-time to form a dynamically generated core.  This mechanism
grants large performance gains over transport methods while maintatining 
acceptable core performance fidelity.

For multi-energy group reactor models using the above algorithm, the scattering 
cross section $\sigma_{s,g\to h,i}$ [barns] is needed to be able to perform 
consistent interpolations. (Here, the subscript $s$ denotes the scattering channel, 
the subscripts $g$ \& $h$ index $G$ incident and exiting energies, and the subscript
$i$ indexes $I$ species.)  This parameter is notbaly more important in thermal reactors
than fast cores.  Furthermore, previous single energy group studies \cite{} did 
not require the group-to-group scattering cross section at all because both 
$g$ \& $h$ are intergated over.

While most Monte Carlo neutron transport codes may compute few group cross
sections (\emph{i.e.} $\sigma_{s,g,i}$), most fail to expose the distribution
of neutron exiting energies after a reaction ($\sigma_{s,g\to h,i}$).  Those
codes which do report exiting energies display only the sum over all consitiuent 
materials in the region of interest ($\sigma_{s,g\to h}$).  Thus obtaining 
the parameters for a perturbation-based reactor model is itself a challenge.

In the initial scoping of library generation (Char) two burnup-coupled transport 
codes were considered: MCNPX (v2.6+) and Serpent (v1.7+).  MCNPX confers the 
ability to compute $\sigma_{s,g,i}$.  Serpent by default will calculate 
$\sigma_{s,g\to h}$ and allows the user to compute $\sigma_{s,g,i}$ as well.

Becuase the group-to-group scattering cross section was already natively supported, 
Serpent was ultimately chosen to statisfy the group constant generation needs of
Char.  However, the source code of Serpent needed to be altered to support 
the reporting of $\sigma_{s,g\to h,i}$.  This modified verion is available upon
request from the author\footnote{This is subject to the same license and restrictions
as Serpent itself.}.

The success of the perturbation-based multigroup model itself serves to validate
the modifications made to Serpent.  However, this study presents a sensitivity study 
which focuses on the group-to-gorup scattering cross section as calculated via 
the modified Serpent.  Here the fuel pin radius set to two different values and 
$\sigma_{s,g\to h,i}$ is calculated for all nuclides.  Values for the scattering 
kernel for intermediate fuel radii were then found via interpolation and modified Serpent 
and compared.  Additionally full-core and region group constants were also compared.

In \S \ref{sec:methodology} is an explantion of the modifications made to Serpent 
and the detailing of the sensitivity study performed.  In \S \ref{sec:results} the 
reults of the sensitivity study are presented.  Lastly, \S \ref{sec:conclusions}
discusses concluding remarks and potential future work.

\section{METHODOLOGY} 
\label{sec:methodology}

This work is composed of two main parts.  The first portion describes how 
Serpent was altered to generate nuclide specific scattering kernels.  
The second portion outlines a fuel radius perturbation study used to 
validate the changes made to the Serpent code base.

\subsection{Serpent Modifications}

The reactor physics code Serpent calculates group transfer probabilities and 
group-to-group scattering cross sections for user-specified geometries and energy 
group structures as part of its standard suite of results.   Call $P_{g\to h}$  
the group transfer probability.  To within computational error, the following 
relations are true:

\begin{equation}\label{P_h_norm}\sum_h^G P_{g\to h} = \mathbf{\vec{1}}\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{P_sig_norm}P_{g\to h} = \frac{\sigma_{s,g\to h}}{\sigma_{s,g}}\end{equation}

Serpent, like other physics codes, allows users to specify materials.
Denote $m_i$ as the mass fraction of the $i$\superscript{th} nuclide 
in a material.  The scattering cross section of the material is thus
the weighted sum of the constituent species:
\begin{equation}\label{mat_norm}\sigma_{s,g\to h} = \sum_i^I m_i \cdot \sigma_{s,g\to h,i}\end{equation}

By combining equations \ref{P_sig_norm} \& \ref{mat_norm}, an expression for the
group transfer probability is obtained which represents the method by which it
is calculated within Serpent.
\begin{equation}
\label{P_serp}
P_{g\to h} = \frac{\sum_i^I m_i \cdot \sigma_{s,g\to h,i}}{\sigma_{s,g}} = \sum_i^I m_i \cdot P_{g\to h,i}
\end{equation}
The desired parameter, either $\sigma_{s,g\to h,i}$ or $P_{g\to h,i}$, lies within
the summation in equation \ref{P_serp}.

Therefore to obtain nuclide-specific scattering kernels Serpernt must be prevented
from executing the above summation for all but the desired species.  Hence, the 
appropriate loop was found and a material filter was added.  As a Monte Carlo code, 
this filter would only be triggered if a scattering reaction occured.  Thus the
addition of this filter did not adversely affect other tallies.  Moreoever, this
filter was included after all physics calculations but prior to reporting.  The 
physics of the reactor was not altered by the use of the filter.

The implementation of the filter works as follows. First,the user specifies
a dummy filter material.  The nuclides present in this material are the species 
which are tallied by the filter.  All other nuclides are ignored, as are the mass 
fraction values.  Then the user sets the material to filter via the new `gtpmat'
option.  This has the syntax `set gtpmat $<$material label$>$'.

Serpent normally outputs the group transfer probability and the group-to-group
scattering cross section to the GTRANSFP and GTRANSFXS variables respectively.
Howver by using `gtpmat', GTRANSFP takes on the filtered value while GTRANSFXS
is invalidated.  The loss of meaning for GTRANSFXS here is not problematic
because, using the detector capability of Serpent, $\sigma_{s,g,i}$ may computed.
This can then be convolved with the newly computed $P_{g\to h,i}$ to obtain
the correct $\sigma_{s,g\to h,i}$.

Since the filter nuclides are given as a set (albeit as members of a material), 
isotope-specific group transfer probabilities are obtained using materials with 
only a single species.  This is the most common usage of the additional `gtpmat'
command.

\subsection{Group-to-Group Interpolations}

The primary purpose of storing sets of multigroup cross sections is 
to be able to interpolate between them.  Since interpolations of existsing 
data is orders of magnitude faster than computing new values via neutron 
transport methods, this allows a perturbation-based reactor model to have
run-time, reactor-state-specific group constants.  Such a model has been
demonstrated \cite{}.  While $\sigma_{s,g,i}$ was explicitly 
verified, the validity of interpolating the group-to-group scattering
cross section was only checked via its aggregation.  Here, interpolations on
$\sigma_{s,g\to h,i}$ are tested explictly.

The state of the reactor and coorespeonding experimental variables are taken
to be the same as in \cite{}.  Neutron energies were discretized into a 19-group
stracture desinged to more finely capture the epithermal region.  Call $E$ [MeV]
a neutron energy. Then $E_g$ [MeV] denotes the energy group boundries.
These are displayed in Table \ref{group_boundaries}.

The core considered here was a standard light-water reactor (LWR) taken from an
OECD/NEA Burnup Credit Criticality report \cite{}.  The reactor was modeled as
an infinite lattice of fuel pin cells.  The benchmark (unperturbed) state of the 
reactor may be seen in Table \ref{benchmark_rx_state}.

To test the validity of interpolating on the group-to-group scattering cross section, 
the benchmark reactor was perturbed twice.  The fuel radius $r_{\mbox{fuel}}$ [cm]
was altered to ensure that non-trivial changes would be made to $\sigma_{s,g\to h,i}$
for at least some nuclides.  Perturbing only the fuel radius has the effect of 
altering the fuel-to-moderator ratio, a highly-important parameter in thermal reactors
such as LWRs.

Hence, the modified Serpent code was run for fuel radii of $\pm 10\%$
the benchmark value. The additional `gtpmat' card was used to create 
group-to-group scattering cross sections for each nuclide under consideration.
Denote the $+10\%$ data with superscript ``$+$'' and the $-10\%$ data with the 
superscript ``$-$''.  Also set the superscript ``$*$'' as data interpolated
from the previous two calculated sets.  A linear interpolation of the 
scattering cross section is given simply as in equation \ref{lin_interp}:
\begin{equation}
\label{lin_interp}
\sigma_{s,g\to h,i}^{*} = \left(\sigma_{s,g\to h,i}^{+} - \sigma_{s,g\to h,i}^{-}\right)\cdot
                          \frac{r_{\mbox{fuel}}^{*} - r_{\mbox{fuel}}^{-}}
                               {r_{\mbox{fuel}}^{+} - r_{\mbox{fuel}}^{-}} + 
                          \sigma_{s,g\to h,i}^{-}
\end{equation}
Such interpolations were carried out for three fuel radii: $-5\%$, $+5\%$, and the 
benchmark fuel radius.

The interpolated scattering cross sections were then compared to the `true'
values (no superscript), as computed via Serpent. A fractional difference 
$\epsilon$ [unitless] is defined as in \cite{}.  Here however, this normalized 
parameter is a function of both incident and exiting energy groups.
\begin{equation}
\label{epsilon_def}
\epsilon = \frac{\sigma_{s,g\to h,i}^{*}}{\sigma_{s,g\to h,i}} - 1
\end{equation}
Positive values of $\epsilon$ indicate that the interpolation over-predicts
the value of the scattering cross section for that $g$ \& $h$ combination.
Negative $\epsilon$ means that an under-prediction has occured.  For this
interpolation technique to be valid, $\epsilon$ should be small for all
incident and exiting neutron energy groups.

While $\epsilon$ is sufficient for testing that $\sigma_{s,g\to h,i}$ is 
valid for a specific $g$ \& $h$, it does not grant any insight into how the 
interpolated scattering kernel performs as a whole.  For this reason, a summary 
metric is desired.  Treating both $\sigma_{s,g\to h,i}^{*}$ and $\sigma_{s,g\to h,i}$ 
as independent measurements of the same underlying physical parameter, the degree of 
likeness between them may be determied using Kendall's $\tau$.

Kendall's $\tau$ is a standard, unitless, statistical rank correlation coefficient.
It is defined on the range $[-1,1]$.  When $\tau=+1$ the inputs are in perfect agreement,
for $\tau=-1$ the measurements are in perfect disagreement, and with $\tau=0$ the 
two inputs are fully independent of one another.  For the scattering kernel, 
values closer to unity are desired.

For an explantation of why the Kendall $\tau$ test is necessary, consider the following
scenario.  Suppose a nuclide is found with an unaccpetablly large fractional 
difference $\epsilon$ for some $g$ \& $h$.  If the value of $\tau$ is sufficiently
close to 1, this implies that the majority of the scattering cross section 
remains valid.  Indeed, there is likely some mitigating factor for the 
group constant which is off.  Further investigation is likely warrented.

Lastly, the interpolations and analysis were performed for the LWR only
at the beggining of life.  This was to minimize extraneous sources of error
coming from interpolating on flunece as well.  Changing the fuel radius also 
alters the burnup profile.  Considering only zero times is done without
loss of generality; cross sections may be interpolated for any equivelent 
fluences.

\section{RESULTS} 
\label{sec:results}

Group-to-group scattering cross section interpolations were performed for
each nuclide for three fuel radii (0.3895, 0.41, and 0.4305 [cm]) inbetween two 
fuel radii (0.369 and 0.451 [cm]) results generated from the modified version of
Serpent.  The interpolated values were then compared to the equivelent data 
generated using Serpent.  Summary statistics are presented in 
Tables \ref{r25}-\ref{r75}.

\begin{table}[htbp]

\end{table}

These summary tables contain all of the nuclides Serpent may natively ccompute
(\emph{i.e.} those present in ENDF/B-VII \cite{}).  The nuclides are sorted from
highest-to-lowest maximum absolute value of the fractional difference $\epsilon$
for all $g$ \& $h$.  Thus the top entry gives a maximal error for all group
constants for all nuclides.  Nuclides whose $\mbox{max}(|\epsilon|)$ is less than 
that of the last entry are not displayed.  The value of this $\epsilon$ is 
shown in the second column.

For the vast majority of species in these three tables the interpolated value of 
the group-to-group scattering cross section is within $\pm 5\%$ of the measured 
value.  Thus in most cases $\epsilon$ is enough to conclude that interpolation 
is a valid run-time technique for generating scattering kernels.

Furthermore many species have fractional differneces within the 2\% mark. 
It is especially impotant to note that \nuc{H}{1} and \nuc{O}{16} lie in 
this regime.  Hydrogen in an LWR is the primary mechanism of neutron 
moderation.  (Oxygen, via its chemical bond with hydrogen in water, also 
plays an important roll).  That the scattering cross sections for these nuclides
are well-determined is key to the reactor model functioning as intended.

However, some nuclides have fractional differences which are above the
\emph{a priori} acceptability mark.  For such species, Kendall's $\tau$ is
shown in the third column of Tables \ref{r25}-\ref{r75}.  The value of
$\tau$ is always greater than $0.75$ and is overwhelmingly much closer to 1.
This result implies that even for nuclides which have a $\sigma_{s,g\to h,i}$ which
is significantly off, that the off indices $g$ \& $h$ are relatively isoloated.  
The rest of the scattering kernel for such species remains valid.
