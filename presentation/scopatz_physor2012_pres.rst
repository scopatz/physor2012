**Goal 2:** 

    Show that we may interpolate between related kernels.


Motivation
==============================
- Multigroup solvers that employ a perturbation-based approach to generate group 
  constants from a small number of pre-computed cases require nuclide specific 
  scattering cross sections.

Motivation
==============================
- Multigroup solvers that employ a perturbation-based approach to generate group 
  constants from a small number of pre-computed cases require nuclide specific 
  scattering cross sections.

* If we may interpolate between kernels, then the method by which 
  we obtain the scattering kernel (typically Monte Carlo) may be performed 
  less often.

- The major application for this is *the Fuel Cycle*.


Context
===============================
We have a perturbation-based multigroup solver in the Bright fuel cycle code [1]. 
This takes pre-computed libraries generated by a utility called Char [2]. 

These libraries are comprised of self-shielded, intragroup flux-weighted 
microscopic neutron cross sections for each nuclide for a suite of reactor states.

Obtaining the Kernel
===============================
MCNPX v2.6+ [3] may calculate:

.. math:: \sigma_{s,g,i}

Moreover, Serpent v1.7 [4] may calculate:

.. math:: \sigma_{s,g,i}, \, \sigma_{s,g\to h}

However, neither compute 

.. math:: \sigma_{s,g\to h,i}

Obtaining the Kernel
===============================
* Since source code modifications were needed [*], Serpent was the easier choice as
  the homogenized material scattering kernel was already tallied.

- In specific Serpent returns the group transfer probabilities [unitless]:

.. math:: \sum_h^G P_{g\to h} = \mathbf{\vec{1}}

.. math:: P_{g\to h} = \frac{\sigma_{s,g\to h}}{\sigma_{s,g}}

.. container:: gray-and-small

    [*] Please contact the author for further information.

Obtaining the Kernel
===============================
The scattering cross section of the material is thus the weighted sum of the
constituent species:

.. math:: \sigma_{s,g\to h} = \sum_i^I \frac{N_i}{N} \cdot \sigma_{s,g\to h,i}

with the number density N [atoms-i/cm3].  Therefore:

.. math:: P_{g\to h} = \frac{\sum_i^I \frac{N_i}{N} \cdot \sigma_{s,g\to h,i}}{\sigma_{s,g}} = \sum_i^I \frac{N_i}{N} \cdot P_{g\to h,i}


Obtaining the Kernel
===============================
* To get around the summation in the above equations, a ``gtpmat`` option was added to Serpent::

    set gtpmat <material label>

    set gtpmat <material label>

- This acts as a filter for the reporting, but not the physics, of scattering.  
  Any species that are contained in filter material will be present in the group transfer
  probability.  All other species are discarded.


Obtaining the Kernel
===============================
* If only a single species is in the filter material, then the per-nulide scattering
  cross section is obtained.

- Runnning a whole suite of single species filters will generate the data Char needs
  to pass on to Bright.

* Previous studies [2] have tested that per-nuclide multigroup scattering cross sections
  may be interpolted.  However, such validation was never performed for kernel interpolation.


Interpolation Experiment
===============================
To test kernel interpolation, first take a lattice of light-water reactor (LWR) fuel pins 
(as described in [5]) and modify the fuel radius by +/-10%.

    :align: center
    :scale: 90%

    NEA/NSC/DOC(93)22." Technical Report January, Nuclear Energy Agency (1994).

Interpolation Experiment
===============================
Then for every species, generate the scattering kernel for the +10% case (``+`` superscript)
and the -10% case (``-``) for a 19 energy group structure.

Interpolation Experiment
===============================
Then for every species, generate the scattering kernel for the +10% case (``+`` superscript)
and the -10% case (``-``) for a 19 energy group structure. 

Then perform a linear interpolation (``*``) based on the 
fuel radius r [cm] to obtain scaterring kernels at radii internal to the bounds:

.. math:: 

    \sigma_{s,g\to h,i}^{*} = \left(\sigma_{s,g\to h,i}^{+} - \sigma_{s,g\to h,i}^{-}\right) 
                              \cdot \left(\frac{r^{*} - r^{-}}{r^{+} - r^{-}}\right)
                              + \sigma_{s,g\to h,i}^{-}

                              \cdot \left(\frac{r^{*} - r^{-}}{r^{+} - r^{-}}\right)
                              + \sigma_{s,g\to h,i}^{-}

Such interpolations were carried out for -5%, +5%, and identically the benchmark fuel radius.

Interpolation Tests
===============================
For every nuclide and incident and exiting energy group, we perform the following 
validation tests between the interpolation result and the "true" value (no superscript) 
as calculated from additional Serpent runs.

* Small relative error:

.. math::

    \epsilon = \frac{\sigma_{s,g\to h,i}^{*}}{\sigma_{s,g\to h,i}} - 1 \ll 1

- Kendall's tau near unity:

.. math::

    \tau\left(\widetilde{\sigma}_{s,g\to h,i}^{*}, \widetilde{\sigma}_{s,g\to h,i}\right) \approx 1

Interpolation Tests
===============================
* Large absorption-to-scattering cross section ratio:

.. math::

    1 \ll R_{a/s,g,i} = \frac{\sigma_{a,g,i}}{\sigma_{s,g,i}}


* Or small group transfer probability:

.. math::

    P_{g\to h,i} < 0.5

Interpolation Tests
===============================
* Large absorption-to-scattering cross section ratio:

.. math::

    1 \ll R_{a/s,g,i} = \frac{\sigma_{a,g,i}}{\sigma_{s,g,i}}


* Or small group transfer probability:

.. math::

    P_{g\to h,i} < 0.5

------------------

If the above relations hold, than the error induced by the interpolation is small enough
to not be of concern for a perturbation-based multigroup reactor model.
