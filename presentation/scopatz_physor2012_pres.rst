Goals
==============================
**Goal 1:** 

    Find the neutron scattering kernel

.. container:: align-center

    .. math::

        \sigma_{s,g\to h,i}

    for all incident and exiting energy groups and species:

.. container:: align-center

    .. math::

        g,h \in G, \, i \in I

**Goal 2:** 

    Show that we may interpolate between related kernels.


Motivation
==============================
- Multigroup solvers that employ a perturbation-based approach to generate group 
  constants from a small number of pre-computed cases require nuclide specific 
  scattering cross sections.

Motivation
==============================
- Multigroup solvers that employ a perturbation-based approach to generate group 
  constants from a small number of pre-computed cases require nuclide specific 
  scattering cross sections.

* If we may interpolate between kernels, then the method by which 
  we obtain the scattering kernel (typically Monte Carlo) may be performed 
  less often.

- The major application for this is *the Fuel Cycle*.


Context
===============================
We have a perturbation-based multigroup solver in the Bright fuel cycle code [1]. 
This takes pre-computed libraries generated by a utility called Char [2]. 

These libraries are comprised of self-shielded, intragroup flux-weighted 
microscopic neutron cross sections for each nuclide for a suite of reactor states.

Obtaining the Kernel
===============================
MCNPX v2.6+ [3] may calculate:

.. math:: \sigma_{s,g,i}

Moreover, Serpent v1.7 [4] may calculate:

.. math:: \sigma_{s,g,i}, \, \sigma_{s,g\to h}

However, neither compute
